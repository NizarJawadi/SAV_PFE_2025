# Stage 1: Build the Angular application
FROM node:18-alpine as build

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Build the application for production
# Adjust the output path if your angular.json specifies a different one (e.g., dist/SAV_Front)
RUN npm run build -- --configuration production

# Stage 2: Serve the application with Nginx
FROM nginx:1.25-alpine

# Copy the build output from the build stage to Nginx's web root directory
# Adjust the source path based on your build output directory (e.g., /app/dist/sav-front)
# We need to check the actual output directory name inside dist/
COPY --from=build /app/dist/sav-front /usr/share/nginx/html

# Copy a custom Nginx configuration file (optional, but recommended for SPAs)
# COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

# Start Nginx
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
